# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-using-CNN-
An Image Classification project to detect wheter a potato leaf has early blight or late blight disease, or its a healthy leaf. 
The model has been trained using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). 
I used FastAPI and Tf-serving for serving the model and accessing it from the front end. 
For front end, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I have used ImageDataGenerator for all the preprocessing and Data Augmentation.
The overall accuracy of model is 88%.
